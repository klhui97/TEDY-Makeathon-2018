## Challenge
Bus Signalling and the Visually Impaired: Even after locating the bus stop, visually impaired people still have trouble signalling the buses to stop at the stop for them. Currently some of them use physical boards to signal buses (which are unwieldy and expensive), but can you design and make a better solution?

## Our mobile solution
```
1. Scrapped all the KMB bus information
2. Analyzed how to get the ETA data
3. Focus on Voice Over (to provide best user exeperience)
4. Voice recognition
```

## Hardware
```
1. Tested with iBeacon
2. Control hardware via Bluetooth
