## Challenge
Bus Signalling and the Visually Impaired: Even after locating the bus stop, visually impaired people still have trouble signalling the buses to stop at the stop for them. Currently some of them use physical boards to signal buses (which are unwieldy and expensive), but can you design and make a better solution?
